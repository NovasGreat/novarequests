<p>10/8/22|1:53:03PM : Everything works, need to fix savable gba emulator and original novasgreat website.<p>
<p>10/8/22|2:03:25PM : Added IodineGBA, but emulator needs bios, which an average person wanting to play games doesnt know how to get and is probably too much work to put in a file just to play one game. Ill put it in there since I already made the site.<p>  
<p>10/8/22|2:57:30PM : Made a new child, or subdomain, attempted to put iframe but noticed it didnt fill. Attempted to fix it but it failed. Scrubbed the plan and deleted the subdomain.<p>
